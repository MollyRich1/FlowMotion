    <p>Hi!  I'm Bonnie Rich.  I'm here to help you find your balance of strength, stability, flexibility and a massive life force that you carry with you for the rest of your life.  I work with individuals who want to maximize their potential of feeling spectacular and moving with intention, integrity, grace and ease.  Feeling great in your body and how you treat it is a huge indicator of life happiness and satisfaction.  As a lifelong and professional ballerina I have been very intentional about my discipline and work ethic when it comes to treating my instrument with the utmost care and respect.  I help people find that ongoing desire to find their best life habits and practices to maximize their joy and energy, without sacrificing the fun or the balance of enjoying your downtime! </p>
    <br>
    <p>I believe that with proper body mechanics, knowing how to initiate movement from the core and understanding and applying  the pilates principles (concentration, control, finding your center, fluidity, precision and breathing) you can take your health and wellness to the highest level, and do it with style and grace.</p>

            I connected with Bonnie Rich almost 5 years ago, and she has had a major impact on my health and well being.
        Bonnie is extremely talented as an instructor, partially due to her training as a professional ballerina with The Hartford Ballet as a soloist. She is trained in different styles of Pilates. <br><br>
        I suffered from migraines and knee and joint pain before we started our sessions. Bonnie is extremely versatile in our sessions and she makes the whole experience so enjoyable, comfortably able to work with an individual despite their fitness level.
        I encourage those to add Pilates with Bonnie to their exercise regime.
