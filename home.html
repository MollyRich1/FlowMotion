    <p>Hi!  I'm Bonnie Rich.  I'm here to help you find your balance of strength, stability, flexibility and a massive life force that you carry with you for the rest of your life.  I work with individuals who want to maximize their potential of feeling spectacular and moving with intention, integrity, grace and ease.  Feeling great in your body and how you treat it is a huge indicator of life happiness and satisfaction.  As a lifelong and professional ballerina I have been very intentional about my discipline and work ethic when it comes to treating my instrument with the utmost care and respect.  I help people find that ongoing desire to find their best life habits and practices to maximize their joy and energy, without sacrificing the fun or the balance of enjoying your downtime! </p>
    <br>
    <p>I believe that with proper body mechanics, knowing how to initiate movement from the core and understanding and applying  the pilates principles (concentration, control, finding your center, fluidity, precision and breathing) you can take your health and wellness to the highest level, and do it with style and grace.</p>

            I connected with Bonnie Rich almost 5 years ago, and she has had a major impact on my health and well being.
        Bonnie is extremely talented as an instructor, partially due to her training as a professional ballerina with The Hartford Ballet as a soloist. She is trained in different styles of Pilates. <br><br>
        I suffered from migraines and knee and joint pain before we started our sessions. Bonnie is extremely versatile in our sessions and she makes the whole experience so enjoyable, comfortably able to work with an individual despite their fitness level.
        I encourage those to add Pilates with Bonnie to their exercise regime.

            BONNIE RICH, PILATES TRAINER EXTRAORDINAIRE<br><br>
So…about Bonnie Rich…<br><br>
My over 70-year-old body and I have had the distinct pleasure and opportunity to train with Bonnie for…probably close to 20 years. When we first began training, it immediately became clear to me that I was in very capable hands.
I often trained 3 times weekly, and each and every session was new and different. Bonnie is inventive and I was never bored.<br><br>

After 6 months in, I had a new body. I had been dancing religiously twice a week in an advanced adult class and lifting weights for many years as well. I soon realized working with Bonnie allowed me to not only “stay sculpted” but kept me limber and also much more relaxed mentally.<br><br>

As I have aged, the high impact from dancing for many years has affected my back and joints. Bonnie enabled me to continue to work out as her knowledge and experience has guided her to make modifications for me.<br><br>

While training in a studio with other instructors also working with clients, I became aware of Bonnie's attention to detail and body placement which other trainers did not have. What truly sets Bonnie apart is her genuine care for the well-being of her clients. She has always listened to my concerns and made me feel safe in her very capable hands.

            I have been a client of Bonnie's now for the past eight months. As a former athlete and coach the thing that impresses me the most is her ability to teach and adjust her workouts accordingly to your body and its needs.<br><br>

She has incredible knowledge of the body and muscle groups, and she has done wonders for me in a short period of time. My body has grown in strength, flexibility, and I owe it all to her ability to push me while at the same time understanding limitations. I would highly recommend her to anybody who wants to work on strength flexibility From a very professional instructor.

            Bonnie is an incredible Pilates instructor and in my personal opinion,  the best in the valley.   Bonnie has a dense amount of kinesiology knowledge and is very well thought out in her instruction. Bonnie's beautiful and sunny demeanor helps everyone feel comfortable and makes each session a positive experience. Pilates is a unique exercise focusing on strengthening your core muscles, improving flexibility, and enhancing body awareness. Bonnie's vast experience in body work and exercise science makes her a knowledgeable and fierce instructor. Her teaching is always engaging and she continues to be aware of her clients abilities and challenges them to their best potential. Her teaching is excellent and is never the same week to week.  All muscle groups get a work out which is fantastic. I can feel that my whole body has transformed and is getting stronger from the inside out based on Bonnie's instruction!  Bonnie also is trained in stretch and often incorporates this in our sessions to ensure my body is in the best possible place.  Bonnie's kind and loving energy makes her a joy to see each session.  She is beyond dedicated to the personal needs of each client and has the ability to modify as needed to fit each person's fitness level. Bonnie has  helped me build more strength than I have ever had. Bonnie is truly one of a kind and I would absolutely recommend you try a session with her…  you won't regret it!!!

            Since I've started working with Bonnie, I feel several inches taller and a lot stronger throughout my entire body! She is a miracle worker and always knows exactly what exercises to work in the session based on what my body needs that day and to provide variety. I was new to Pilates, and a bit nervous, but Bonnie has always made me feel so supported and capable of doing anything! I'm excited to continue growing and getting stronger with Bonnie.
